## How to use it:

You can use the Action as follows:

- Update the `.github/workflow/main.yml`file to include a step like this:
```yaml
 - name: Run SOOS SCA Scan for vulnerabilities
   uses: soos-io/soos-sca-github-action@v2 # Check the latest major version here: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/soos-core-sca
   with:
    project_name: "My Project Name"
    client_id: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
    api_key: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
```

The `soos-io/soos-sca-github-action` Action has properties which are passed to the action using `with`.

For example, you can choose to exclude specific directories from scanning:

`.github/workflow/main.yml`:
```yaml
name: Example workflow using SOOS
on: 
  push:
    branches: 
      - main 
    paths:
      - package.json
jobs:
  synchronous-analysis-with-blocking-result:
    name: SOOS SCA Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - uses: actions/checkout@master

    - name: Run SOOS - Scan for vulnerabilities
      uses: soos-io/soos-sca-github-action@v2
      with:
        project_name: "My Project Name"
        directories_to_exclude: "**bin/start/**, **/start/**"
        client_id: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
        api_key: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
```

### SARIF Report Example

`.github/workflow/main.yml`:
``` yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: SOOS SCA SARIF Example CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: SOOS SCA Analysis
        uses: soos-io/soos-sca-github-action@v2
        with:
          project_name: "<repository_owner>/<repository_name>" # Also you can use the var ${{ github.repository }}
          output_format: "sarif"
          client_id: ${{ secrets.SOOS_CLIENT_ID }}
          api_key: ${{ secrets.SOOS_API_KEY }}
```
